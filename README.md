# Unit Converter

A small, client-side Unit Converter built for the Scrimba Full Stack Developer course. This is a solo project to demonstrate basic JavaScript DOM manipulation and unit conversion logic.

## Features
- Convert between common units (examples: length, mass, volume).
- Simple UI built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
- Input validation and user-friendly error handling.


## Usage
- Enter a numeric value in the input field.
- Conversion results update automatically.

## Project structure (typical)
- `index.html` -- main HTML page and app entry.
- `index.css`  -- styling and responsive rules.
- `index.js`   -- conversion logic and event handlers.
- `README.md`  -- This file.


## Implementation notes
- Conversion logic is implemented in plain JavaScript as part of project requirement; 
- Focus is on readability and learning.


## Contributing
This is a solo course project. If you want to experiment, fork the repo and open a PR with improvements or additional unit types — keep changes small and well-documented.
